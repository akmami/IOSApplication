# IOSApplication

IOS Application that I have developed during my internship

This projects is developed during my internship in Rapsodo. I have used the concepts and technologies of Swift while implementing small programs.

I have developed VideoPlayer, DrawinnApp, Edit/View Profile Pages, Animation, etc. Please download and build the project for the details.

I have used both Storyboards and SwiftUI technologies (and connects them at the single projects).

I have used CoreData, UIKit, Combine, Realm and NasaAPI for retrieving and storing the data.
